I sang
Alanlaye
Echoes surround me
Alanlaye, laye
Gave me strength

300 grams
Pour the rice inside a sieve
Rinsing a few times
Stirring them gently
Transfer to a pot
With a splash of mirin
Lu-lu-lu
Bring up to boil
Lu-lu-lu
Let it steam
Lu-lu-lu
Fluffing them up into your box
Leftovers and salted plum

Alanlaye
Up on mountain top
Alanlaye
Sitting by myself
I opened the box
So simple, so special
The salt, salt
From my eyes, they dropped

Rightfully

Post-Chorus
Always
You never fail to drain my tears
And bring my face to smile


Old frozеn rice
Chopped kimchi, green onions
Heatеd sesame oil
The smell of happiness
Stir fry in a wok
Sizzle, sizzle, pi-li-li
Lu-lu-lu
Fried egg on top
Lu-lu-lu
Egg: “Forget me not”

Alanlaye
Though I am blank
Alanlaye
Nothing on my mind
There's no room to
No room to fit in another human
That's okay
Laye, layeye
You will always be there during my selfish escapes
My favourite food
Favourite view
Invite me to live another day
Post-Chorus
Always
You never fail to drain my tears
And bring my face to smile
